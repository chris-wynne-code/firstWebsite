                <p class="grid-item3"> Even though Leo is currently in his
                    final year of amassing crippling
                    debt studying a BA in Film, TV and
                    Digital Production at Royal
                    Holloway the University of London,
                    Leo's work experience extends his
                    skillset beyond the limits of a classroom.</p>

                <p class="grid-item5">From editing interviews to music videos, his portfolio reflects
                    a varied skillset of not just editing,
                    but animation and graphic design too.
                    Communicative working in a
                    team but confident on his own, Leo
                    enjoys any chance to edit a project.</p>
